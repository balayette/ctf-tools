Easy instruction counting with QEMU, in both user and system mode.
Build the patched QEMU, symbolic link it to ./patched_qemu (see
https://github.com/balayette/qemu) and then read ./counting.py --help

Also supports perf, which is less accurate than QEMU, but is nice to have
because QEMU might fail to emulate obscure instructions.

Also supports pin, which is even slower, but why not?
To use pin, symlink the pin binary to ./pin, and the inscount0.so shared library
to ./inscount0.so

gdbcount.py does instruction counting with gdb, patch it to suit your needs.
