Easy instruction counting with QEMU, in both user and system mode.
Supports i386/x86_64 userspace QEMU, and all architectures of system QEMU.
Build the patched QEMU, symbolic link it to ./patched_qemu (see
https://github.com/balayette/qemu) and then read ./counting.py --help

Also supports perf, which is slower than QEMU, but is nice to have because
QEMU often fails to emulate obscure binaries.

Also supports pin, which is even slower, but why not?
To use pin, symlink the pin binary to ./pin, and the inscount0.so shared library
to ./inscount0.so

gdbcount.py does instruction counting with gdb, patch it to suit your needs.
